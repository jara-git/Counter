# Counter
Counter Redux- JS


# a single file which you will be able to divide into sections.
# Below is the hierarchy to repeat in your file:
# |-- index.html
# |-- main.js
# In the index.html file, you will place the tags corresponding to a counter, that is to say, a paragraph in which to display the result, together with an “add”, a “remove” button, “add 10”, a “remove 10” button and reset button.
# In the main.js file, you’ll need to include the following sections: actions, reducers, store, and main – which we will review in the next sections.
